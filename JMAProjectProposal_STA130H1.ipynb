    "The variables examined when answering this question would have to be split into two groups. These two groups would be seperated on those who indicated that they identify as indigenous and those who do not identify as indigenous. We can further narrow down our data by focusing on data based off of the region indicated in a persons answer. This way we would be able to compare data from those living in provinces that have a higher population of indigenous people living on reserves, compared to data from those living in provinces that have a lower population of indigenous people living on reserves. This could help us get a more sound answer to our question, since there is no specific indicator of wether or not the data comes from living on a reserve. Second, once we split up the data on indigenous identity and then region/province we would analyze the statistical data (such as the mean, and quartile percentile of the answers receieved) from a columns that indicates ones emotional and physical health. These columns would be the WELLNESS_self_rated_physical_health and the WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health. The data could be even further seperated and analyzed by age, since this could analyze traditions/culture and how that has evolved over time. The way to examine these variables could be done with a bar plot, a bar plot is helpful in giving us a comparison between two categorical groups, before looking at the statistical data. Another visualization that would be helpful is box plots, box plots can show us the statiscal data such as the mean value of how each group ranks thir own physical and mental health, or even see the lowest quartile to see in comparison just how low the indigenous population ranks their own wellness in compared to non-indigenous populations. For example, if indigenous identifying individuals do face more discrimination and less social interaction their lowest percentage might be a lot lower than the lowest percentage of non-indigenous populations.

Once we can get a clear comparison between the two we can then perform an analysis to see if there is any correlation between a lower mental/physical wellness and their indigenous identity to each region. To analyze a correlation we would have to look at a linear regression model. The linear regression model by using indicator values. However, in using indicator values we are making an assumption that most people indicating that they are indigneous are living on reserves. "

By running through each connection activity we can then see if there is more frequency of answers in one variable compared to another variable.

The first step to doing this is to make sure we clear out all of the NaN values through .dropna or some other way. Through multi-classification we can turn the string responses into inetgers, numerical values, making them easier to plot.

To go about this we would have to clear out the data to make sure it is all known values and then import the necessary libraries to create the graph for us.
